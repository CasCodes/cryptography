# CryptoUI

CryptoUI is a minimalist GUI for testing the famous Cesar & Viginere ciphers. It supports encrypt & decrypt. Cesar also includes a 'hack' function which tries to crack the key to a given ciphertext.

## Install

2. Make sure all libraries are installed by running `pip install -r requirements.txt` inside the _cryptoUI/_ folder
